# Registry

We're happy just to have you at our ceremony with us, so no one should feel obligated to bring a gift. If you still 
would like to though, we would prefer gifts of cash which we'll use to help pay for our upcoming honeymoon in Maui. 

You can send them to our [Cash App](https://cash.app/stephalexwedding) or [Venmo](https://venmo.com/axemorgan), and 
we'll also have a box for cards at the reception.
