##### Attire

Keeping in mind that it will be a hot summer day, dress as formal as you want. But... we'd like to keep things 
__smart casual__ at least. (Yeah, we had to [google that](https://www.saratoga.com/images/infographic-dress-codes.jpg) too.)  
Bottom line, be cool ‚ùÑÔ∏è, *be cool* üòé, and be you!

and gluten-free options.
