# Q & A

##### What's the attire?

Keeping in mind that it will be a hot summer day, dress as formal as you like, but we want to keep things at least 
__smart casual__ (yeah, we had to [google that](https://www.saratoga.com/images/infographic-dress-codes.jpg) too.) Bottom line, be cool ❄️, *be cool* 😎, and be you!

❀

##### What food will be served?

Light snacks will be served during cocktail hour, followed by dinner and dessert. Each of these will include vegetarian 
and gluten-free options. 

❀

##### Do you have a registry?

We're happy just to have you at our ceremony with us. We don't have a registry, but we will have a box for cards at the 
reception.

##### Do we need to pay to get in to the nature center?

No payment is needed to get in—just tell the gate staff that you're here for the Weddle-Morgan wedding. Then follow the signs to Groesback Estate.
